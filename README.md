# Algos_Quantopian
My Quant algorithms developed for the Quantopian platform:

* [SMA 10 months] (https://github.com/David-Carrasco/Algos_Quantopian/blob/master/SMA_10_months.py)

    Algorithm based on Mebane's Faber SMA 10 months [Paper Link](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=962461).   
    Instead of using the last SMA month, in this case the SMA is compared to the last 2 months to operate.
